  "issue_description": "The payload sensor on Unit #15 is not working correctly. It's failing to detect when a bin has been placed on it, so it never proceeds with the delivery task. We've cleaned the sensor surface and checked for obstructions. Is there a way to reset or test the sensor directly?"
