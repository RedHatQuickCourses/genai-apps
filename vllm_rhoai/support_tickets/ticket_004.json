  "issue_description": "One of our robots, Unit #12, is constantly getting stuck in Sector G. We recently re-taped the floor markings, and it seems the robot's navigation sensor isn't reading the new lines correctly. Is there a sensor calibration procedure we need to run? I can't find it in the standard user manual."
