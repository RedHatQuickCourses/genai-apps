  "issue_description": "I'm trying to define a new 'no-go' zone in the Fleet Management software around a temporary maintenance area, but the zone won't save. Every time I draw the polygon and click 'Confirm', I get a generic 'Update Failed' error with no details. The existing zones work, but I can't add or modify any."
